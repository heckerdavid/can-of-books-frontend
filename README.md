# Can of books

**Author**: Roop Hayer, David Hecker

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

something with books

## Getting Started


READ book data by connecting front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Express server will connect to a Mongo database. It will need to make a “schema” in back-end code to model how want  data to look. It will then populate database with “seed” data—some of favorite books. When the front end makes a request to server, server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Front end will display these results.
Functionality for the user to create a book resource in the database or delete one. A book will be created from a form in React, and sent to the server where it will be saved into the database, and then returned to the front end to be displayed in the list of favorite books. It will then be able to delete that book with a click of a button, to have it instantly removed from the front end, with a request sent to back end for removal.


## Architecture

We will be building CRUD app with MongoDB
